# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects in Python

This repository contains two applied case studies demonstrating a complete **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** workflow in Python — from raw data ingestion and cleaning to feature engineering and visualisation.  
The projects highlight how to extract insights from diverse datasets using `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`.

## Projects Overview

### **1. 911 Calls Analysis**
**Goal:** Explore temporal and spatial trends in emergency call records.  
**Highlights:**
- Parsed timestamps into year, month, day, and hour features.
- Grouped by call reason (EMS, Fire, Traffic) and visualized call distributions.
- Created time-series plots and heatmaps to identify peak periods and seasonal patterns.

**Skills demonstrated:** datetime manipulation, grouping and aggregation, categorical encoding, multi-axis plotting.

### **2. Finance Data Analysis**
**Goal:** Examine stock price behaviour, volatility, and inter-company relationships.  
**Highlights:**
- Collected stock data via `pandas_datareader` (Yahoo Finance API).
- Computed daily and cumulative returns, and rolling moving averages.
- Visualized price correlations and co-movement through heatmaps and scatter matrices.

**Skills demonstrated:** time-series analysis, correlation analysis, rolling statistics, visualization design.
